mportant structures in plant development are buds, shoots, roots, leaves, and flowers; plants produce these tissues and structures throughout their life 
from meristems located at the tips of organs, or between mature tissues. Thus, a living plant always has embryonic tissues. By contrast, an animal embryo 
will very early produce all of the body parts that it will ever have in its life. When the animal is born (or hatches from its egg), it has all its body 
parts and from that point will only grow larger and more mature. 
However, both plants and animals pass through a phylotypic stage that evolved independently and that causes a developmental constraint limiting 
morphological diversification.

According to plant physiologist A. Carl Leopold, the properties of organization seen in a plant are emergent properties which are more than the sum of 
the individual parts. "The assembly of these tissues and functions into an integrated multicellular organism yields not only the characteristics of the 
separate parts and processes but also quite a new set of characteristics which would not have been predictable[by whom?] on the basis of examination of 
the separate parts.
